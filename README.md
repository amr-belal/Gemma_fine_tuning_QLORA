## Description
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning models using the Gemma framework. The notebook is designed to run on a GPU and includes all necessary steps for setting up and executing the fine-tuning process. It leverages the power of the `bitsandbytes` library for efficient computation.

### Key Features
- Fine-tuning models with ease
- GPU acceleration
- Comprehensive setup instructions

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- bitsandbytes

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
